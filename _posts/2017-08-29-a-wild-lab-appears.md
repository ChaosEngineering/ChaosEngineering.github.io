We are here, hanging out for a few days with a friend and his family due to a mandatory evacuation where we live. The (now) tropical storm has made its way out to the Gulf again and is supposed to make landfall again to the East of us. This is a good thing, since storms of this nature always spin in a counter-clockwise rotation. That means we will get the 'dry' side of the storm. We're doing OK and staying dry. Yesterday was terrible, the water in the street was a steady level because the literally non-stop rain did not allow it to drain. Today, the water has drained and, so far, it isn't raining as bad.

Back to the matter at hand... I've been working on an automated process to create new virtual machines and assign them the appropriate roles and responsibilities. So, I have a few simple scripts that I'm working on that are useful to this process. Today, I'm going to work on polishing them up and creating functions that will have some important features that will provide flexibility. Then, I'm put them all together and create a module that can be used to aid in the process.

More to come.
