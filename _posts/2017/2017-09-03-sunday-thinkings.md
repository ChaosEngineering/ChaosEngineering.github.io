Just sitting here thinking about the disaster that befell our area this past week. I think it affected everyone to various degrees. My family was affected just a bit and I'm thankful for that blessing. I have to ask friends to help me. They're coming over tomorrow to help clean our storage unit because it got a few inches of water in it. We're going to lose some stuff and it's just stuff, nothing that can't be replaced. I'm reading on-line about friends that have lost some and some that have lost everything.
