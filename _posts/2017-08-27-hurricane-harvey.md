I'm learning how to program websites and work with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), CSS, and SCSS. Today was pretty productive, I setup this website and figured out a whole bunch of the internals of how [Jekyll themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) work. Working with responsive design is pretty fascinating and using Chrome's dev tools is pretty fascinating. It's nice to be able to edit the page live and watch what the different CSS code does in real-time. I think the next thing I'm going to do in this arena is setup my own Linux server running LAMP and Jekyll to work with my sites locally before uploading them to the GitHub site. I'm doing a whole lot of pushes to their servers since I'm not very proficient.

I'm using [Atom](https://atom.io) to edit my code. Its integration with Git is awesome and being able to preview markdown instantly is a real life saver, since I'm learning that as well.

Well, that's about it for now about this. I think I'm going to write about some PowerShell stuff.
